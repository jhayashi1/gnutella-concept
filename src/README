This project can be built using make

flags:
    -p (PORT): set the port to listen on
    -connect (IP:PORT): connect to node with ip and port formatted ip:port (ex. 127.0.0.1:1234)
    -q (FILENAME): query for a file based on its name after joining network (ex. hello.txt)

The default sleep time is 60 seconds and if a node does not ping after 2x the sleep time then it is dropped
The default TTL for requests is 5
The files are read from and written to ../files/(port number)
Instead of implementing a query hit, the query contains the ip and port of the node and opens a tcp connection to it to send the file
